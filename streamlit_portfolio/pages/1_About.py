st.write("""
I’m Matthew Kiedaisch, a Mathematics major at the University of Texas at Austin with a strong interest in quantitative finance, data analytics, and systems built on logic, precision, and performance.

Outside of academics, I stay focused on long-term growth — whether that’s through data-driven personal projects, consistent strength training, or refining fundamentals in golf. Years of competitive hockey instilled in me a disciplined, analytical mindset that I now apply to both technical work and professional development.

I’m currently building a portfolio of projects centered on simulation, modeling, and predictive analytics. This site highlights what I’ve worked on so far and reflects the direction I’m actively pursuing.
